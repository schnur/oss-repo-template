Andriod uses the Apache License to meet there goal "We wanted to make sure there would always be an open platform available for carriers, OEMs, and developers to use to make their innovative ideas a reality. We also wanted to avoid any central point of failure, so no single industry player could restrict or control the innovations of any other. Our single most important goal with AOSP is to make sure that open source Android software is implemented as widely and compatibly as possible, to everyone's benefit." The Apache License is a good fit because "It allows users to use the software for any purpose, to distribute it, to modify it, and to distribute modified versions of the software under the terms of the license, without concern for royalties".
