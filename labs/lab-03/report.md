Welcome to the oss-repo-template wiki for Ryan Schnur!

I'm interested in multiple areas such as AI,Webdev, or Gamedev due to my low experience in the topics. Projects that I find interesting are Wrathskeller (Frank Matranga is a good friend of mine) and an interactive map for witcher 3 (https://github.com/witcher3map/witcher3map) (I'm a big fan of the game and books). If neither of those projects pans out I would be open to projects that use Pytorch, React, Godot, or other tools that fall under the topics I would like to explore. At the end of the semester, I hope to have a well-documented project that has at least the basics but can easily be added to form other contributors.
